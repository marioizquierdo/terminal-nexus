# Terminal Nexus — content interfaces

_How units, structures, factions and armies are described to the engine. Split from the engine design; every unmarked statement is GUIDANCE._

## 8. Content interfaces — GUIDANCE

These are sketches. Names and shapes will change the first time real content touches them, and that
is expected. **Do not build these interfaces before content needs them.**

```ts
type ContentId = string
type EntityId = string
type Tick = number
type Rational = Readonly<{ numerator: number; denominator: number }>
type ResourceCost = Readonly<Record<ContentId, number>>

interface UnitDefinition {
  readonly id: ContentId
  readonly layer: "workers" | "units" | "air"
  readonly roleTags: readonly string[]
  readonly footprint: Footprint
  readonly maxHealth: number
  readonly supply: number
  readonly movementRate: Rational
  readonly speedTier: number
  readonly attack?: ContentId
  readonly capabilities: readonly ContentId[]
  readonly presentation: ContentId
}

interface AttackDefinition {
  readonly id: ContentId
  readonly range: number
  readonly damage: number
  readonly speedTier: number
  readonly cooldownTicks: number
  readonly targetRules: readonly ContentId[]
  readonly presentationCue: ContentId
}

interface StructureDefinition {
  readonly id: ContentId
  readonly roleTags: readonly string[]
  readonly level: 1 | 2 | 3
  readonly footprint: Footprint
  readonly maxHealth: number
  readonly cost: ResourceCost
  readonly buildRadius?: number
  readonly storage?: number
  readonly supply?: number
  readonly workerSlots?: number
  readonly production?: ProductionRecipe
  readonly attack?: ContentId
  readonly presentation: ContentId
}

interface ProductionRecipe {
  readonly output: ContentId
  readonly quantity: number
  readonly cost: ResourceCost
  readonly intervalTicks: number
  readonly spawnRule: ContentId
}
```

Upgrades, Nexus powers, Commanders, and Commander Armies follow the same pattern and are described in
[`commander-armies.md`](../game-design/commander-armies.md). A **Commander Army** is the playable content boundary:
the complete set of choices legally available to one player in one match — a Nexus and faction, a
Commander, starting units and structures, blueprints and a tech tree, upgrades, Nexus powers, and
Specials, bounded against its faction's pools
([`commander-armies.md`](../game-design/commander-armies.md) Section 2.1). The match, the Pulse, and every renderer
see an army; none of them ever sees a faction.

Prefer composable capabilities — health, movement, attack, production, storage, supply, worker slots,
radius, restoration, regroup anchor — over inheritance. Exceptional behaviour may register narrow
hooks that receive read-only context and return intents for the kernel to validate. A hook API
protects engine integrity; it is **not** a security sandbox, and installed TypeScript is arbitrary
local code.
